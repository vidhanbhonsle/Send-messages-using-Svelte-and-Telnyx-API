 1. Sign up for Telnyx account
    > Set up a developer account with Telnyx from https://telnyx.com/sign-up.

 2. Obtain a number with SMS capabilities for auto-responder app
    > After creating an account and signing in, you need to [acquire a number](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/numbers/search-numbers) for the application. Search for a number by selecting your preferred 'Region' or 'Area Code'.
    
    > Make sure that the number supports SMS feature(Very Important!) as it will be used by our application.
 
 3. Create a messaging profile
    > Next create a [messaging profile](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/messaging) by clicking on "Add new profile" and provide a suitable profile name to it(you do not need to provide any other detail for now).

 4. Configure the number for messaging
    > Go to the [numbers](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/numbers/my-numbers) page, look for the number you created and set the number's `Messaging Profile` to the profile you created in the previous step.

### Step 2: Svelte Setup
Svelte provides a different approach to building web apps than some of the other frameworks. While frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the user's browser while the app is running, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens only when you build your app, producing highly-optimized vanilla JavaScript.

<summary><strong>Steps to follow</strong> (click to expand)</summary><p>

 1. Create Svelte application skeleton
    > Open terminal/command prompt or code editor
    > Run following command
     ``` shell
    npx degit sveltejs/template YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
    ``` 
    degit is a project scaffolding tool to create skeleton.

 2. Obtain the ngrok setup file and follow the steps mentioned
    > Download the ngrok setup file as per your OS from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup and follow the steps mentioned on the page.
    
    > You need to run the setup file (It has zero run-time dependencies!)
    
    > In the `Step 3`, you need to change the command to
     ``` shell
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
    > After running the above command, you would see something similar to following:
    
    <img src='./img/ngrok_tunnel.png' width="800"/> 

    > Copy the highlighted 'Forwarding' address. we will need it in next step. 

    ``` shell
    http://0ab4-2405-201-300a-ecf1-201a-6ad8-c0d4-eddd.ngrok.io
    ```
 3. Edit Telnyx messaging profile to add webhook
    
    > Go to [messaging profile](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/messaging) and click on the message profile you created earlier.

    > It will open "Edit Messaging Profile" page, here under "Inbound Settings" you need to provide value to 'Send a webhook to this URL' 

    > The value is Forwarding address we copied in the previous step. Append it with '/webhooks'. It will look like this -

    ``` shell
    http://0ab4-2405-201-300a-ecf1-201a-6ad8-c0d4-eddd.ngrok.io/webhooks
    ```
    <img src='./img/inbound_webhook.png' width="800"/>

    > **Always keep the ngrok process running, do not stop it or restart it!** Because it will lead to a changed URL, which then will require you to repeat the above steps each time.
